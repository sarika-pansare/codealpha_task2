# Unemployment Analysis with Python

This is **Task 2** of the **CodeAlpha Data Science Internship**, focused on analyzing unemployment trends in India using Python. The project includes dataset retrieval, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and trend visualizations.

##  About the Project

This project explores unemployment rates in India using publicly available data. The dataset includes state-wise unemployment statistics along with geographic and temporal information, enabling region-based and time-based insights.

##  Key Features

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Correlation heatmap visualization
* Regional unemployment comparison
* Time-series trend visualization

## Tech Stack

* Python
* Pandas (data manipulation)
* Matplotlib and Seaborn (data visualization)

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following columns:

* `Region`: State or region name
* `Date`: Record date
* `Frequency`: Data frequency (monthly)
* `Estimated Unemployment Rate (%)`
* `Estimated Employed`
* `Estimated Labour Participation Rate (%)`
* `Region.1` (renamed to `Zone`): North, South, East, West
* `longitude`, `latitude`: Coordinates

## 📊 Data Analysis & Visualization

1. **Heatmap** – Shows correlation between numeric fields
2. **Bar Chart** – Unemployment rate by region
3. **Line Chart** – Time-based unemployment trend by zone

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone/download the repository
2. Ensure Python 3 is installed
3. Install required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```
4. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python task2unemployee.py
   ```

## ✅ Result & Insights

* Clear variation in unemployment rates by region
* Visible COVID-19 impact on employment trends
* Notable differences in participation rate and job numbers

## 🚀 Future Scope

* Use ML to predict future unemployment trends
* Combine with GDP, education, or industrial data for deeper analysis
